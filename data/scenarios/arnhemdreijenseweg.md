#### **Historical Overview**

Almost everyone has heard of “ *The Bridge Too Far”* and *Operation Market Garden* . Anyone with an interest in the
battle will have their own favourite theories about what went wrong, and how the battle could have been won by the
Allies. Any serious student of the battle with have read Robert Kershaw’s fascinating book “ *It Never Snows In*
*September”.* One of the key themes in the book is an insight into quite how close to success the Allies actually were.
How, time after time, the German positions at Arnhem were precariously close to giving way, and then just in time,
reinforcements would arrive. This scenario focuses on one element of the bitter fighting that took place on day 3 of the
Battle of Arnhem - a pivotal day for the 1 [st] Airborne Division. Whilst Frost was isolated and fighting for survival at the
bridge, Tuesday 19 [th] September saw the last realistic opportunities for the rest of the Division to break through
German blocking lines and to reinforce the defenders at the bridge.

**The Opening Stages of** ***Operation Market Garden***

*Operation Market Garden,* was a massive operation undertaken by the
Allies to try and restore momentum to the breakout from France, using
their vast Airborne resources to outflank the Siegfried Line and force a
Rhine crossing in Holland. But strategic errors had already been made
that were to come back to haunt the operation. The failure to secure
the Scheldt estuary allowed tens of thousands from the German 15 [th]

Army to escape from the Breskens pocket into Holland and the thin
crust ahead of the British forces at the border started to thicken.
Remnants of formations that had escaped from Normandy were in
desperate need of refitting and reorganization. Far to the rear, the
military facilities and training areas around Arnhem had been selected
as the ideal location to rebuild 9SS and 10SS Panzer Divisions from
Bittrich’s II Panzer Corps. Although these formations were only the
shell of the powerful divisions from Normandy, their presence around
Nijmegen and Arnhem was to prove pivotal.
The hardest mission fell to 1 [st] British Airborne Division. They were
tasked with seizing and holding the last bridge in the chain – Arnhem
Bridge. However, crippling limitations were placed on the air plan.
Requests for a drop-zone close to the bridge to land a coup-de-main
were turned down. Concerns about flak and using the soft polder-land
close to the bridge led to the selection of drop-zones and landing-zones several miles west of Arnhem.
Inexperience of aircrews and shortening autumn daylight hours led to a restriction of one “lift” per day. The four
brigades (1 [st] Airborne Division and the Polish Brigade) were scheduled to arrive over 3 days. The advantages of
airborne operations, surprise and the ability to drop astride objectives, were thrown away. On the first day, 5,700 men
of the Division were scheduled to land but barely 2,000 men (1 [st] Parachute Brigade) would be able to move to secure


-----

Arnhem bridge. The remainder would all have to remain west of Arnhem to secure DZs and LZs for subsequent lifts.
For the Germans, it would be a battle of resourcefulness, both in the way that the few available troops were used and
also in the ability to match and exceed the Allies’ rate of reinforcement. German field commanders were encouraged
to take the initiative and react vigorously to whatever situation they found themselves in, precisely the response that
was to be required as *Market Garden* unfolded. Seen as a safe rear zone, there were several training (AuE) battalions
in the area, as well as 9SS and 10SS Panzer Divisions, rebuilding after Normandy. The soldiers might have been
inexperienced and part-trained, but many
units were commanded by experienced
officers and NCOs. It was their reaction that

would be crucial in the battle ahead.

The vast operation got underway at
12:40pm on Sunday September 17 [th] when
the pathfinders from 21 [st] Independent
Company started to set up markers and
beacons. Twenty minutes later, close to 300
gliders commenced their landings on LZ-Z
followed by 1 [st] Parachute Brigade on DZ-X.
By 15:00, units started to move off onto their
allocated tasks – 1 [st] Parachute Brigade
advancing towards Arnhem, 1 [st] Airlanding
Brigade securing the DZs & LZs.
One of the first Germans to witness the
landings was SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer
Krafft, commander of a Panzer-grenadier
training battalion on exercises in the woods around Wolfheze. Seeing the vast scale of the landings, he quickly
appreciated that Arnhem would be the main objective. With barely 500 men at his disposal he formed a blocking line
between Wolfheze and Oosterbeek. Elements of 9SS (possibly from the Reconnaissance Battalion) soon arrived in
the area of the main road into Arnhem. First Gough’s Reconnaissance Squadron, then 1 & 3 Para, all came up
against these blocking lines and advances ground to a halt. Only Frost’s 2 Para, with Brigade HQ, managed to the
slip past to the south to reach Arnhem bridge. Finally outflanked as night fell, Krafft withdrew to the north.

Late evening and overnight, aware now that British troops had slipped through to reach the bridge, the Germans
sought to isolate these forces from the rest of the Division. Desperately throwing units forward as soon as they
arrived, alarm companies mainly from 9SS started to take up positions between Krafft (on the Amsterdamseweg) and
the Rhine. These ad-hoc Kampfgruppe were named their commanders. Amongst the first to arrive were gunners from
9SS Artillery Regiment (SS-Lieutenant-Colonel Spindler), engineers from 9SS Pioneer Battalion (SS-Captain Moeller)
and dismounted crews from 9SS Panzer-Jaeger Battalion (SS-Captain von Allworden). There was no fixed line and in
confused fighting overnight and on Monday 18 [th], first 1 Para, then 3 Para, slipped past to enter the west of Arnhem.
Ahead of them was yet another blocking line - troops from 9SS Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 20 had taken up position
in the streets close to the Museum, where the narrowing gap between the railway and the Rhine would funnel any
attack. The railway line entering Arnhem from the west was now a defining feature, crossing undulating ground
through a series of embankments and cuttings, all of which were a major obstacle to troop deployment. South of the
railway, the British had managed to open a corridor from Oosterbeek into Arnhem. KG Moeller held the line of the
railway. North of the railway at Oosterbeek, KG Spindler and KG Allworden managed to re-establish a blocking-line
along a lane through the woods, the Dreijenseweg, to KG Krafft on the Amsterdamseweg. A further KG, from a
Wehrmacht Panzer-Grenadier training battalion under Capt. Bruhns arrived to strengthen the defenses.

On the afternoon of day 2, perhaps daring to think that they were stabilising the situation, the men of these KG then
watched with dread as the skies filled with the gliders and parachutes of the 2 [nd] lift, bringing in Hackett’s 4 [th] Parachute
Brigade. With the South Staffords now at full strength, the British had four more battalions available; the pendulum
had swung back in the Allies favour. As the day drew to a close, Hackett was asked to release 11 Para who, with the
South Staffords, were to join the battle in the town. In return he received KOSB, now moving into position on LZ-L for
the next day’s 3 [rd] lift, bringing in heavy equipment for the Polish Brigade. Hackett was to seek to dominate the high
ground north of the railway. Not only was this area the Division’s
main designated resupply zone (SDZ-V) but a breakthrough here
would force the over-stretched Germans to completely reorganise
their defensive lines. As night fell, patrols from KOSB and 156 Para
came across outposts close to a road through the woods. They had
found KG Spindler’s blocking-line on the Dreijenseweg.

Tuesday September 19 [th] saw the climax of the battle for control of
Arnhem. In the town, depleted 1 and 3 Para, reinforced by South
Staffords and 11 Para, pushed hard to break through the block-line
at the narrowest point close to the St Elisabeth’s Hospital and
Museum. Outside of the town, Hackett’s forces prepared to try and
force their way across the Dreijenseweg. West of them, KOSB on
LZ-L held positions to secure the landing-zone for the 3 [rd] lift of the
Polish gliders.

## **Maps & Terrain**

Woodland: Yellow tree = orchard Light green = cleared wood Dark green = woods with underbrush
Hedges: High hedges shown as Other hedges are low hedges
Railway The railway is a significant obstacle across the entire map. It can be crossed without restriction at the 4 marked crossings only
Embankment & cutting – troops must conform and breach. Impassable to vehicles
Other areas – all units must conform and breach. Vehicles must conduct one bog-down check (to reflect line-side fencing and ditches)
The railway line itself counts as “featureless terrain” and receives +1 modifier. The act of crossing (not breaching) can trigger opportunity fire

## **Umpire’s Briefing**
#### ***Game Outline***

Phase 1: British player hold should be briefed to attack vigorously to secure objectives.
German player will receive a steady stream of reinforcements as you see fit. If his defense is holding then
he should be allowed to deploy these freely in preparation for counter-attack. If his defense is stretched
then these should be directed to forming a new blocking line (X-X). He may counter-attack at any time.

Transition: Umpire decides on the exact timing depending time available & situation on the ground

Phase 2: British player receives orders to withdraw with immediate effect south of the railway. 2-3 turns later (once
an element of confusion has set in), the 3 [rd] lift should arrive.
German player – if counter-attack not yet started, he should now be ordered to launch a general attack

***British Forces:***

Brigade HQ

General Brigade elements – unrestricted use (anti-tank guns, RASC etc)
Glider Pilot Squadron – may allocated to any Battalion or held in reserve
Engineer Squadron– may allocated to any Battalion or held in reserve
21 [st] Independent Company – 1 platoon on LZ-L, rest remain ***south*** of railway

KOSB

Orders: protect LZ-L but some elements can be used for attacking:

        - up to two Parachute companies

        - all support elements (including Reconnaissance Troop)

10 Para

Orders: secure the area around the pump station and crossroads at the end of the Dreijenseweg and then to
attack in support of 156 Para

Two companies “up” with reserve company released when one company is “established” north of the
Amsterdamseweg (established typically means 5 stands including a company commander)

156 Para

Orders: secure the woodland east of the Dreijenseweg and then to attack towards the Amsterdamseweg
Two companies “up” with reserve company released when one company is “established” east of the
Dreijenseweg (established typically means 5 stands including a company commander)

***Oosterbeek Railway Crossing***
Any student of the battle will know the future significance of the railway crossings. Hackett was aware of the shift in
the Divisional positions from Wolfheze into Oosterbeek since he had met with Hicks at the Hartenstein late on the
Monday night. Why he did not make a move to secure this crossing is unclear. Perhaps his preoccupation with
securing the cross-roads at the top of the Dreijenseweg distracted him from the obvious advantage of securing the
crossing at the bottom of the Dreijenseweg? It would be acceptable for the British player to try and gain control of this
area of Oosterbeek but ***not*** with elements of 10 or 156 Para. An attack for instance by KOSB supported by Glider
Pilots and/or Engineers would be acceptable.

***Change in Orders***
About half-way through the game time (game turn 8-12 approx), the British player should be told the following:
*“There has been a major reverse suffered by the forces in the town. Details are sketchy but there have been heavy*
*losses and strong German forces, including armour, will be attacking imminently, in strength, from Arnhem. You are to*
*halt offensive action with immediate effect. Preserving anti-tank guns and transport are high priority.*
*Brigade units, 10 Para and 156 Para are to move as quickly as possible to the south of the railway*
*KOSB are to remain in position to protect LZ-L; the third lift is expected within the next 30 minutes”*

***Third Lift***
The lift was delayed and therefore the Luftwaffe was not in the air when the gliders finally came in to land. Therefore
German air support ends once the gliders appear.

The third lift should arrive once the situation on the board has become a bit chaotic – hopefully with elements of 10
and 156 Para crossing LZ-L and German troops appearing at the edges of the LZ


-----

***Glider Landings***
Umpire places gliders at the start of their run-in and AA fire takes place at this position.
Try and allow only **one** AA fire against each glider
Glider lands 18” ahead of this initial placement

All glider units fire at the **nearest unit** (use Parachute Infantry stats) in the overwatch phase of the turn they landed.
Units take on the order status of the glider (good order, suppressed, disordered)

Unloading a glider takes place the following turn and requires 2 actions.
A friendly unit that is within, or moves to within, 1” of a glider may assist unloading and contribute 1 action
Disembarked units are placed within 1” of the glider model
Example – glider lands in good order close to a KOSB parachute infantry unit.

Fires in overwatch phase at the infantry with no effect.
The following turn, the KOSB infantry uses 1 action to move to within 1”.
Glider unloads jeep & ATG with one action of its own and one action form the KOSB.
Jeep hitches ATG using 2 [nd] action – ready to move off the next turn.

## **British Player Briefing**
#### **Situation**

**Brigadier John “Shan” Hackett, 08:00 Tuesday September 17** **[th]** **1944, LZ-L**

How true are von Clausewitz’s words “No plan survives contact with the enemy”. But it
would have been a bonus if your plans had lasted even that long. The drop yesterday
afternoon on Ginkel Heath was not unopposed, but KOSB had largely achieved the
impossible task of keeping the Germans off the drop-zone and by all accounts your
Brigade is only about 100 men short of full strength. But you did not anticipate the
degree of chaos that you found with the rest of the Division. General Urquhart, along
with Brigadier Lathbury, have not been seen since late Sunday evening and are
missing, presumed dead or captured. Pip Hicks was the senior officer on the ground
when the General went missing, so, although technically your junior, it is perhaps understandable that he has taken
command of the Division. But already his decisions have stretched your patience. Whilst still on your drop-zone you
were informed by a junior officer, no discussion, that 11 Para were being detached from your command and sent to
join the battle in the town. Despite losing a third of your strength, it appears that your task remains the same as before
– to dominate the northern approached into Arnhem. You have been surprised but the lethargy that seems to be
permeating through the Division. Not in your Brigade. Within an hour of dropping, your remaining battalions were
marching east towards Arnhem. As evening lengthened 10 Para and 156 Para were pushing into the woods at the
eastern edge of LZ-Z whilst KOSB were securing the LZ for today’s 3 [rd] lift. Some brisk firefights confirmed that you
had come up against a line that the Germans were holding in strength. You men overran the outposts but you called a
halt for the night when they reached a lane through the woods, the Dreijenseweg. Heavy automatic fire from the
woods beyond the lane suggest that this is a strong position.

At about 22:00 last night, you had headed off in your jeep, through Wolfheze, to reach Divisional HQ in Oosterbeek.
This had been your first opportunity to try and establish from Pip Hicks what the heck was going on. Your simmering
annoyance came close to boiling over immediately after you had arrived. There was 11 Para sitting on the lawn in
front of Divisional HQ. If the situation had been so critical that Hicks had seen fit to detach them immediately after
they had dropped, then why were they still sitting here on their arses 6 hours later? If you had still had them under
your command then you might have been in a position to have pushed across the Dreijenseweg in strength tonight.
As your meeting with Pip Hicks progressed, the situation became more and more strained. The man was clearly out
of his depth and, with excuses about communication problems from malfunctioning radios, he seemed to have very
little grip on what was actually going on. Garbled messages had come through from Johnnie Frost at the bridge. He
was hanging on and denying use of the bridge to the Germans, but no-one seemed really sure about the rest of 1 [st]

Parachute Brigade. One thing that everyone was sure about was the strength of the opposition. Within hours of
landing, it had become clear that many of the troops in Arnhem were SS Panzer troops. Seasoned opponents and
armour – not really what your men had been led to expect.

So what now? We desperately need to try and wrest the initiative back. The Germans are aware that the Division
received significant reinforcements yesterday but they do not know where the next attack will be. Yes, they can
predict that moves will be made in the town to try and reach Johnnie Frost. But there have not been any significant
attacks made yet in this sector. Although clearly faced by a defensive line on the Dreijenseweg, there must be weak
points in the line. You must attack immediately and vigorously. The Germans will be bringing in reinforcements as
quickly as possible – they will only get stronger. Your chances of success will diminish as time goes by.

**156 Para Commander, Lt.-Col. Sir Richard des Voeux**
As the most experienced battalion, the Brigadier has given you the most difficult task – to lead the assault across the
Dreijenseweg towards the high ground at the Koeppel. Once across the Dreijenseweg, you should continue to move
to the east setting up platoon strong-points that establish a defensive line between the Koeppel and KOSB on LZ-L.

**10 Para Commander, Lt.-Col. Ken Smyth**
You are to seek to dominate the junction of the Dreijenseweg with the Arnhem – Ede road, the Amsterdamseweg.
Your first objective is to secure a complex of buildings, the “Pump House” and then to move to secure the crossroads
at the north end of the Dreijenseweg. From here you should advance, as appropriate, to secure the north flank for 156
Para’s advance towards the Koeppel.

**KOSB Commander, Lt.-Col. Robert Payton-Reid**
Although now nominally under command of 4 [th] Parachute, your original briefing remains to secure LZ-L for the third
lift. Due to a combination of lost gliders and enemy action, each of your Companies is now 1 platoon under strength.
Even so, your battalion remains the most powerful in the Brigade and you may be asked to take part in the Brigade’s
attacks. Threats to the LZ could come from anywhere and the only approach that is probably secure is from the south.

#### **British Deployment, Notes & Special Rules**

21 [st] Independent Company are rated as *elite* ***.*** All other British forces are rated *veteran*
The scenario will last about 12-15 turns. The British player moves first

**Deployment**
Brigade HQ - Brigadier Hackett should deploy where shown, other Brigade units deploy as for KOSB

         - any Brigade ME and/ or units may be attached to battalions at the start of the game

         - no restriction on movement/ redeployment

10 & 156 Para - deployment areas as shown. All elements must deploy within these areas

         - one company is held as reserve in the deployment area until released by the umpire

KOSB - all elements must deploy in the LZ-L rectangle (Amsterdamseweg, Dreijenseweg, railway, road)

         - HQ is sited in the Johannahoeve Farm

21 [st] Independent - 1 platoon (3 units) at the centre of LZ-L. Remainder in woods/ building where indicated

**British Artillery**
The airborne 75mm howitzer and the 3” mortars all use **small IDF templates -1/0**
On-board mortars add in discipline rating modifier
Radio communication difficulties around Arnhem are well known. All call-for-fire is subject to a -1 (negative) modifier.

Ammunition Restrictions:

*1* *[st]* *Airlanding Light Regiment*

You are limited to 9 battery-turns of HE fire and 3 battery-turns of smoke
*Battalion Mortars*

Unlimited HE fire but you are limited to 3 turns of smoke

Fire plan options:


10 and 156

-1/0 -1/0 0/+1 -1/0 -1/0 -1/0

Single battery or Battalion mortars or
(add in discipline rating)




Regiment 0/+1 0/+1 0/+1 KOSB ‘2x2’ or ‘4x1’ ‘2x1’ or ‘1x2’
Single battery or Battalion mortars at -1/0 or at 0/+1
(add in discipline rating)

2 ” Mortars
These may fire unlimited dissipated smoke. They may fire in four ways:

1) Self-spotted mortar fire
2) Indirect fire using call-for-fire by another unit within the ME
3) Indirect fire called automatically at a target in the LOS by another ME unit **whose base is within 1”**
4) Direct fire using own weapons as per card


-----

**Railway**
The railway is a significant obstacle and can be crossed without restriction at the 4 marked crossings only
Embankment & cutting – troops must conform and breach. Impassable to vehicles
Other areas: all units conform and breach. Vehicles must conduct one bog-down check (line-side fencing and ditches)
Railway line itself is “featureless terrain” and receives +1 modifier. The act of crossing can trigger opportunity fire

**Deployment of Antitank Guns**
The British have been allowed to start with troops on the Amsterdamseweg and the Dreijenseweg. These advance
over-night positions were infantry positions only. The initial deployment for antitank guns must be at least 5” away
from these roads

**Improved Positions**
The ground in this area was very sandy and ideal for creating basic improved positions, unless tree roots were getting
in the way. To reflect this, any unit not in woodland (orchards do not count as woodland) may create a basic improved
position simply by expending 2 actions. Units in woodland create improved positions in the normal way with a +1
(easier) modifier.

**Glider Landings**
Umpire places gliders at the start of their run-in and AA fire takes place at this position.
Glider lands 18” ahead of this initial placement

Units take on the order status of the glider (good order, suppressed, disordered)

Unloading a glider takes place the following turn and requires 2 actions.
A friendly unit that is within, or moves to within, 1” of a glider may assist unloading and contribute 1 action
Disembarked units are placed within 1” of the glider model
Example – glider lands in good order close to a KOSB parachute infantry unit.

The following turn, the KOSB infantry uses 1 action to move to within 1”.
Glider unloads jeep & ATG with one action of its own and one action form the KOSB.
Jeep hitches ATG using 2 [nd] action – ready to move off the next turn.

**Definition of Armour**
For manoeuvre check purposes, a Bren Carrier only counts as armour if it has an embarked MG

**Transport**
All transport must be placed on table.
Armoured transport counts towards casualty calculation whereas soft skinned transport does not.

**Recommended Optional Rules**

## **German Player Briefing**
#### **Situation**

**SS-Lt.-Col. Walter Harzer, Heselbergherweg School, 08:00 September 17** **[th]** **1944**

The last 48 hours have seen chaos and confusion of a bewildering level but you are now
gaining confidence that your men can bring the situation firmly under control. The day
before yesterday afternoon you had been a few kilometers away at Hoenderloo at a
parade to present SS-Captain Graebner with his Knight’s Cross. By yesterday morning,
he was dead. As the parade was drawing to a close, Allied planes were filling the skies and reports were soon
streaming in of massive paratroop landings all over the area. After urgent discussion with Bittrich, it was decided that
you would try and stabilize the situation in Arnhem with your 9SS *Hohenstaufen,* whilst Heinz Harmel’s 10SS
*Frundsberg* took responsibility for Nijmegen. Despite the critically weak state of your Division, within the hour various
alarm companies were heading south to the Arnhem area.

From early reports, it seems that you owe a debt of thanks to SS-Oberst. Sepp Krafft. He has been in this area for
months with his SS-Panzer-Grenadier Training Battalion (ironically they have been sending replacements mainly to
the Fuhrer’s favourite 12SS *Hitlerjugend* ). They happened to be out training in the area between the drop-zones and
Arnhem and he managed to predict most of the British moves, causing considerable disruption to their advances.

Obviously Graebner’s Reconnaissance Battalion was best placed to provide the required rapid response. Leaving a
platoon to bolster Krafft on the Amsterdamseweg you had ordered him to proceed with haste to secure Arnhem
Bridge and if possible to find out what was going on down the road in Nijmegen. Impulsive as ever, finding Arnhem
free of British, he had carried on to Nijmegen without leaving a garrison at the bridge. Soon it became clear that a
sizeable British force had slipped past Krafft and secured the bridge area. Stuck on the wrong side of the river, aware
that his error had made Harmel’s job of getting his Division into Nijmegen infinitely harder, Graebner’s recklessness
finally cost him his life yesterday morning. Basically he gambled that his Recce troops could bounce back across the
bridge. His gamble did not come off and in the process he paid with his life.

Yesterday, the situation remained totally confused. Despite efforts to form block-lines and isolate the troops at the
bridge, the British seemed to slip past again and again. Out of town, it was clear that they were gaining control of
Oosterbeek and the area south of the railway line. But in town, close to the Hospital and Museum, you had placed a
strong force of several hundred men from SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 20, strengthened by several assault guns.
Weaker blocking lines remained in place out of town. But surely they could not attack everywhere at the same time?

But then yesterday afternoon, the skies filled again with Allied planes and thousands more enemy soldiers must have
arrived by glider and parachute. Out-posts have reported quite a lot of activity in the area north of the railway at
Oosterbeek. Bittrich reports that captured documents show this area is to be used for another wave of landings later
today. Is this activity simply forces protecting this landing zone, or are the British preparing a major attack north of the
railway. The problem is that you cannot cover every possible eventuality. Your gut instinct tells you that something is
happening here and you have desperately been trying to find units to bolster defenses.

Your main strength here is your artillery! Spindler’s SS-Artillery Regiment 9 may only have enough guns for a weak
battalion of 2 batteries, but it has plenty gunners who know how to fire a rifle. They have set up a block-line in the
woods along the Dreijenseweg. Late yesterday evening, SS-Captain von Allworden arrived with a couple of
Panzerjaeger IVs and enough dismounted crew to form 2 more weak companies. They are in place to the north
providing the link between Spindler and Krafft’s positions on the Amsterdamseweg. Some Wehrmacht troops have
appeared from one of their Panzer-Grenadier Training Regiments. Quality? A big unknown, but beggars cannot be
choosers. Some have gone to reinforce positions in the town but one weak battalion under Captain Bruhns has
moved into position on the edge of Oosterbeek. At least they have a few half-tracks to their name! You hope more
reinforcements on the way but who knows where and when they will arrive.

What then is the plan?
In town, the blocking line past the Museum must hold fast. You expect
that the Assault Guns of xxx will swing the balance here.

Out of town, you are not so confident. You are desperate to amass
enough reserves to launch an attack on the landing-zone but this
means that Spindler must hold the line on the Dreijenseweg. If this line
is broken, then those reserves that do arrive will have to go forming a
new blocking line. If the British can battle through into the north of
Arnhem, then your block-line by the Museum is out-flanked.

So Spindler, Allworden, Bruhns – hold your lines. Preserve any
reinforcements and as soon as the local situation allows, move
vigorously over to counterattack and seize control of the landing-zone.

#### **German Deployment, Notes & Special Rules**

German units discipline ratings are a mix of *experienced* and *trained*

Front-line units (rebuilding) are generally rated *experienced* as they are often ‘out-of-role’
Training battalions are generally rated *trained*
The scenario will last about 12-15 turns. The British player moves first

**Deployment**

***KG Krafft*** Deploys north of Amsterdamseweg as shown
Starting forces SS Pz-Gren AuE 16 (2 companies)
This KG is expecting reinforcements and is likely to be taking the lead role in a counter-attack

**KG Allworden** Mainly deploys north of Amsterdamseweg as shown

Starting forces SS Pz-Jaeger Abt 9 (2 companies plus 1 Pz-Jg IV and 1 PaK 40)
This KG should seek to dominate the junction of the Dreijenseweg and the Amsterdamseweg

***KG Spindler*** Deploys west of Dreijenseweg between main road & railway
Starting forces SS Artillery Abt.9 (2 companies)
This KG has the difficult task of defending the main part of the Dreijenseweg

***KG Bruhns*** Deploys as shown
Starting forces Ersatz Regt 57: Abt. 64 (1 company plus 3 SdKfz 250/1)
Luftwaffe troops (1 company)
This KG has some SdKfz 250’s that should be useful in defending the Dreijenseweg.
You have the option of extending defensive positions across the Dreijenseweg and south of the railway
If planned reinforcements arrive then it too should take an active role in any counterattack

**Air support**
During *Market Garden* there was definite role-reversal regarding air support. The Allies had little effective air support,
mainly down to communication difficulties and the impossibility of knowing where the front line actually lay. On the
other hand, aided by details of planned lifts & drops, the Germans often seemed to have planes in the air during
planned landings and resupply drops.
####  In each of his air support phases, the German player should roll a d10 and receives air support if the dice roll

equals or is lower than the game turn (example – turn 4 needs to roll 1, 2, 3 or 4)
####  The umpire will declare when air support is no longer available  In a turn with air support, a further dice roll determines the actual air support:

1-3 Single Me-109
4-6 Single FW-190 All air support is single strafing attack only, no second pass the following turn
7-8 Two Me-109 All aircraft enter aligned with the north board edge
9-10 Two FW-190


-----

**German Artillery**
Generally very limited as most units are ad-hoc Kampfgruppe or rapidly deployed alarm companies
Kampfgruppe Spindler is based on the 9SS Artillery Regiment and did manage to bring some artillery into the area.
This artillery is available **only to units of Kampfgruppe Spindler**

Ammunition Restrictions:

*SS-Artillerie Regiment 9*

You are limited to 8 battery-turns of HE fire and 3 battery-turns of smoke
*Battalion Mortars*

Unlimited HE fire but you are limited to 3 turns of smoke

Fire plan options:

Single battery or

Battalion -1/0 -1/0 -1/0 -1/0 or 0/+1 0/+1

or

**Railway**
The railway is a significant obstacle and can be crossed without restriction at the 4 marked crossings only
Embankment & cutting – troops must conform and breach. Impassable to vehicles
Other areas: all units conform and breach. Vehicles must conduct one bog-down check (line-side fencing and ditches)
Railway line itself is “featureless terrain” and receives +1 modifier. The act of crossing can trigger opportunity fire

**Transport**
All transport must be placed on table.
Armoured transport counts towards casualty calculation whereas soft skinned transport does not.
Kubelwagens and Schwimmwagens are interchangeable

|Notes on the German Order of Battle As units arrived, the KGs were constantly remodelled. Most units on the Dreijenseweg became part of KG Spindler. For the sake of clarity, they will remain in these four KGs: KG Spindler Original forces formed from the gunners of 9SS Artillery Battalion (SS-Artillery-Abt.9) May receive reinforcements from a 9SS Flak unit (SS-Flak-Abt. 9) KG Allworden Based on dismounted Panzer-jaeger crews from SS-Pz-Jaeger Abt 9 May receive reinforcements from a passing company of naval troops KG Krafft Original forces were from SS Pz-Gren AuE 16 (SS-Pz-Gren training battalion) May receive reinforcements (Flottstam Regt 1 Abt 1 & Marine Regt 642 Abt 1) KG Bruhns A diverse KG based on a Wehrmacht Pz-Gren training battalion (Ersatz Regt 57: Abt. 64) which attached a company of passing Luftwaffe ground troops May receive reinforcements from Ersatz Regt 5: Abt. 64 & battalion of security troops (Infantry Sicherungs Abt. 908)|Col2|
